Centralizing the power of the group can help in a variety of ways, essentially turning into a democracy, since we are a data analytics group, we can perform forms like this to garner public opinion about important decisions and partnerships which the key figures in the group can use to pin point the most agreeable decision to make based on majority voting though we should restrict this kind of voting to notable members of the group who actively contributes and cares about the community as a whole. Maintaining open communication is the main part of this important implementation meaning that every decision passed should be announced, we should run it like a Monitory Democracy which is ""??one person, many interests, many voices, multiple votes, multiple representatives."" A change driven by its members thus fulfilling the goal of the community.","LinkedIn, Indeed, OnlineJobs.ph",International Client,30 to 34
